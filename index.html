        <h3>About My Projects</h3>
        <p>
          I've been fortunate to work on a variety of projects that have helped
          me grow as a developer. I've learned many technical skills as well as
          soft skills, such as team leadership and managing a project pipeline.
          I've also learned how to work with clients to ensure their vision is
          realized. All of the following websites are responsive to screen
          sizes, whether it's an ultrawide desktop, a tablet, or a mobile
          device.

        <h3>Pokemon Trivia Website</h3>

        <p>
          The Pokemon Trivia Website offers a dynamic and interactive
          experience. I had a lot of fun working on this project despite not
          knowing Pokemon very well. You can customize your quiz based on
          different generations of Pokemon, and create an account to keep track
          of your scores. The website features a leaderboard for competitive
          scoring, utilizes CSS animations, a spelling detection method that
          determines if your answer is "close enough," and a hint feature to
          help you out. Unfortunately we lost our ability to store user data due
          to a database crash, so you can't currently create an account or view
          the leaderboard. But you can still take the quiz and enjoy the
          experience! We may return to this project to fix this issue in the
          future.

          Tech talk: This website is developed using a tech stack that includes
          HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, and Google Firebase. It utilizes APIs to
          fetch Pokemon data, Express.js and Node.js for server-side operations,
          and MongoDb as a NoSQL database for user data management.

          Allemons Landscaping is a website tailored for a local landscaping
          business. It's not yet been finalized, hence not having its own domain
          yet, the lack of detailed information, and no side pages yet. I've
          been collaborating closely with the business owner. I incorporated
          their requirements and offered a spectrum of choices to align the site
          with their vision. The site includes a night mode toggle and an
          interactive map.
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: This site was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The map
          uses the Google Maps API.

          Aurora Auto Works is a website tailored for a local car restoration
          business. Collaborating closely with the business owner, I
          incorporated their requirements and offered a spectrum of choices to
          align the site with their vision. The site boasts a neat,
          easy-to-navigate interface. A gallery page is currently in the
          pipeline and will soon showcase the stellar work of the business. The
          owner also requested custom email addresses for the business, which I
          set up using Google Workspace.
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: This site was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
          custom emails were set up using Google Workspace.

        <p>
          The Movie Database Browser provides a list of movies that you can
          search through or filter. It uses API connections to MovieDB.com,
          providing you with an extensive catalogue of films to browse and
          discover. It lets you sort movies based on their certification (such
          as PG-13), their review scores, and/or their genre. Or you can search
          for a specific movie. You can also view a movie's description,
          runtime, and release date. It also includes the option to add a movie
          to your watchlist.
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: The website uses HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React for a
          smooth and intuitive user interface. The back-end functionality is
          achieved with Express.js and Node.js, allowing seamless interaction
          with the MovieDB's API to fetch and display data.
