        <h3>Pokemon Trivia Website</h3>
        <a href="https://pokemon-trivia-project.web.app/" target="_blank"

        <p>
          The Pokemon Trivia Website offers a dynamic and interactive
          experience, perfect for both Pokemon aficionados and trivia
          enthusiasts. I had a lot of fun working on this project despite not
          knowing Pokemon very well. You can customize your quiz based on
          different generations of Pokemon, and create an account to keep track
          of your scores. The website features a leaderboard for competitive
          scoring, engaging CSS animations, and a hint feature to assist you in
          tricky situations. Unfortunately we lost our ability to store user
          data due to a database crash, so you can't currently create an account
          or view the leaderboard. But you can still take the quiz and enjoy the
          experience!
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: This website is developed using a tech stack that includes
          HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, and Google Firebase. It utilizes APIs to
          fetch Pokemon data, Express.js and Node.js for server-side operations,
          and MongoDb as a NoSQL database for user data management.

        <p>
          Aurora Auto Works is a website tailored for a local car restoration
          business. Collaborating closely with the business owner, I
          incorporated their requirements and offered a spectrum of choices to
          align the site with their vision. The site boasts a neat,
          easy-to-navigate interface. A gallery page is currently in the
          pipeline and will soon showcase the stellar work of the business.
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: Keeping it light and quick, the website is built using the
          timeless trio of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h3>Movie Database Browser</h3>
        <a href="https://moviedb-project.surge.sh/" target="_blank"

        <p>
          The Movie Database Browser is a treasure trove for film lovers. It
          uses API connections to MovieDB.com, providing you with an extensive
          catalogue of films to browse and discover. It lets you sort movies
          based on their certification (such as PG-13), their reviews, and/or
          their genre. Or you can search for a specific movie. You can also view
          a movie's description, runtime, and release date. It also includes the
          option to add a movie to your watchlist.
          <br /><br />
          Tech talk: The website uses HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React for a
          smooth and intuitive user interface. The back-end functionality is
          achieved with Express.js and Node.js, allowing seamless interaction
          with the MovieDB's API to fetch and display data.
